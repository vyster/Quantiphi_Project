Data Taxonomy of AO Video Intelligence Features

# Introduction
## Objectives
Exploring how extracted data features can be leveraged for Media purposes through ML/AI techniques ie. making Knowledge Graphs and Taxonomies. Focus is on how these and other heterogeneous data sources and techniques can be combined into a flexible architecture that can further build a high level Architecture to create Taxonomies and Knowledge Graphs. Use the Graph Index and Other representations to tell the Taxonomies, for lets say, a Search Recommendation System. Knowledge graphs can be made by using JSON for better SEO to leveraging taxonomy ie. Combining knowledge graphs and machine learning etc.

## Input and Output Data form
The resulting metadata (topics, named entities, sentiments, etc.) from the features team are to be Analysed and stored in a graph database to support further analyses and more precise retrieval. The graph is structured according to a well-defined and evolving ontology and these Graph databases can understand the connections in large and varied data sets. Metadata can run through further ML pipelines for single- and multi-label classification, clustering, event detection, and social network analysis in general.
